<h2>Romanized Hokkien for People Who Read Pinyin</h2>

<p>Some of the lyrics I romanize are a mix of Hokkien and Mandarin. This can be confusing for people who’ve only used Pinyin: Hokkien has many sounds not in Mandarin and uses a different romanization system.</p>

<p>This guide is meant to supplement my lyric romanizations for people who aren’t very familiar with Hokkien but would like to learn.</p>

<hr>
<h3>Intro to Hokkien Sounds</h3>

<p>Hokkien has “b”, which is the English <span class="unicode">/b/</span> sound that Mandarin doesn’t have; “p”, which is the Mandarin sound <span class="unicode">/p/</span> that is “b” in Pinyin, which English does not have; and “ph”, which is the <span class="unicode">/pʰ/</span> sound that is “p” in Pinyin and English. This extends to other consonant groups: <span class="unicode">/d/ /t/ /tʰ/</span> and <span class="unicode">/g/ /k/ /kʰ/</span>.</p>

<p>Much like other non-Mandarin languages descended from Classical Chinese, Hokkien has consonants that can be their own syllable. If you see “m” without a vowel attached, that’s pronounced “mmm”; if you see “ng” without a vowel attached, try pronouncing “ung” and dropping the “u” sound.</p>

<p>Hokkien also can have “ng” as the initial consonant.</p>

<p>Initial “g” is often silent.</p>

<hr>
<h3>Hokkien Romanization</h3>

<p>I romanize Hokkien using Tâi-lô, which is the current system used by the Taiwanese government and popular online dictionaries like iTaigi. Prior to Tâi-lô’s creation, <span class="unicode">Pe̍h-ōe-jī</span> (POJ) was the predominant system and is still used by some textbooks.</p>

<table class="unicode">
<thead>
<tr><th style="width: 4em">Tâi-lô</th><th style="width: 4em">Pinyin</th><th style="width: 5em">IPA</th><th></th></tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td>p</td><td>b</td><td>p</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>ph</td><td>p</td><td>pʰ</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>b</td><td class="none">none</td><td>b</td><td>Same as English “b”</td></tr>
<tr><td>t</td><td>d</td><td>t</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>th</td><td>t</td><td>tʰ</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>d</td><td class="none">none</td><td>d</td><td>Same as English “d”</td></tr>
<tr><td>k</td><td>g</td><td>k</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>kh</td><td>k</td><td>kʰ</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>g</td><td class="none">none</td><td>g</td><td>Same as English “g”</td></tr>
<tr><td>ts</td><td>z, j</td><td>ts, tʑ</td><td>* (in POJ: ch)</td></tr>
<tr><td>tsh</td><td>c, q</td><td>tsʰ, tʑʰ</td><td>* (in POJ: chh)</td></tr>
<tr><td>j</td><td class="none">none</td><td>dz, dʑ</td><td>* Same as/similar to English “j”</td></tr>
<tr><td>s</td><td>s, x</td><td>s, ʑ</td><td> *</td></tr>
<tr><td>oo</td><td class="none">none</td><td>ɔ</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>nn</td><td class="none">none</td><td>˜</td><td>Preceding vowel is nasal (in POJ: ⁿ)</td></tr>
<tr><td>-h</td><td class="none">none</td><td>ʔ</td><td>Like the first “h” in “uh-oh”<br>(this only applies to “h” at the end of a syllable)</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>* These are only pronounced with <span class="unicode">/ʑ/</span> in front of an “i” (same as how in Mandarin, “j”, “q”, and “x” can only appear in front of “i” or “ü”).</p>

<hr>
<h3>Other Things You Should Know</h3>

<p>No one uses consistent Chinese characters for Hokkien words, except for dictionaries. A lot of official lyrics are partial translations into Mandarin; others use colloquial characters or Mandarin homonyms. I always romanize based off what I hear.</p>
